CRITICAL:

graphic? - raylib, sdl
 - 2 versions - graphic, tui

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file) ?

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehicles))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the data files

world gen

movement
	have i missed something?

TODO:
move more stuff to data files
	- maybe convert them to a well known format?
		- INI (TOML?), json, yaml?

tests
	- more entity creation
	- more world map gen
	- dijkstra maps
	- key val reader

make code readable -> longer variable names ?
add a license (not needed yet?)
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? (could be done through settings)
	- settings
shorten all lines longer than 80
refactoring ?
initialization macros ?
different (stronger) enemy type
rewrite stuff
actual dungeons (?)
or actual worldgen?
	- overworld - villages and stuff
	- dungeons - fixed size
rewrite wmap gen algs
make the drawing and input functions bindings independent of ncurses
	- ui.h ui.c ?
move data files into different directory (~/.local, AppData)
generalize the drawing functions -> preparations for graphics
rewrite and refactor
opensimplex noise
!!! free all alloc'd memory - most of it in the init functions (check valgrind)
valgrind make target?
clean up the key_val_reader.c file, make it not made of spaghetti code
	- maybe use getline?
optimize pathfinding allocation (if dijkstra_map != NULL)
REWRITE THE ENTIRE DIJKSTRA PATHFINDING ALG, ITS SHIT
