 if i use graphics, then i must use the urizen 1bit tileset

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file) ?

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehicles))
	populate the data files

world gen

movement

add a license (not needed yet?)
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? (could be done through settings)
	- settings
shorten all lines longer than 80
refactoring ?
initialization macros ?
different (stronger) enemy type
rewrite stuff
actual dungeons (?)
or actual worldgen?
	- overworld - villages and stuff
	- dungeons - fixed size
rewrite wmap gen algs
move data files into different directory (~/.local, AppData)
rewrite and refactor
opensimplex noise
!!! free all alloc'd memory - most of it in the init functions (check valgrind)
clean up the key_val_reader.c file, make it not made of spaghetti code
	- maybe use getline?
optimize pathfinding allocation (if dijkstra_map != NULL)
REWRITE THE ENTIRE DIJKSTRA PATHFINDING ALG, ITS SHIT
overmap tiles?
	world would be travelled by moving between the overmap tiles, each of a
	different type
