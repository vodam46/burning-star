CRITICAL:

windows installation
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66063363/how-to-compile-ncurses-program-for-native-windows-use
graphic? - raylib, sdl

drawing
	how to deal with different window sizes
		- generate a larger map, but draw only a portion of it (endless levels)

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file)

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehiclec))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the types files

CURRENT ORDER OF STUFF:
maze solving - for entities

	- a*
enemies
	- combat system

TODO:

basic menu - then generalize into a function

tests
	- map

movement into own file

CONSISTENT NAMING STYLE

file system

make code readable -> longer variable names ?
add a license (not needed yet)
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? (could be done through settings)
	- settings
make map struct
optimize basic_dir
shorten all lines longer than 80
refactoring
get entity attrs from file
initialization macros ?
better wall drawing
fix enemy spawning at player position
steal pathfinding and better maze gen alg from /home/vodam/c-maze-generation
