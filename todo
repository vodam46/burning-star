CRITICAL:

(somewhat) unfinished files:
	- entity.h entity.c

	- map.h (map.c)

movement
	- requires map, rendering, main game loop

drawing
	what func:
		- addch()
		- printw()
		- addstr()
	how to deal with different window sizes
		- change map size
	
	
world data structure

	done through dynamic 2d arrays (need to learn how to do them)
		- manual memory allocation
			( looks like soon ill be writing games in assembly )
		- see "dynamic_array" in previous folder

	tile struct
		- entities
		- type
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehiclec))
