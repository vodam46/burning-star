CRITICAL:

graphic? - raylib, sdl
 - 2 versions - graphic, tui
 if i use graphics, then i must use the urizen 1bit tileset

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file) ?

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehicles))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the data files

world gen

movement
	have i missed something?

TODO:
move more stuff to data files
	- maybe convert them to a well known format?
		- INI (TOML?), json, yaml?

tests
	- more entity creation
	- more world map gen
	- dijkstra maps
	- key val reader

add a license (not needed yet?)
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? (could be done through settings)
	- settings
shorten all lines longer than 80
refactoring ?
initialization macros ?
different (stronger) enemy type
rewrite stuff
actual dungeons (?)
or actual worldgen?
	- overworld - villages and stuff
	- dungeons - fixed size
rewrite wmap gen algs
make the drawing and input functions bindings independent of ncurses
	- ui.h ui.c ?
move data files into different directory (~/.local, AppData)
generalize the drawing functions -> preparations for graphics
rewrite and refactor
opensimplex noise
!!! free all alloc'd memory - most of it in the init functions (check valgrind)
valgrind make target?
clean up the key_val_reader.c file, make it not made of spaghetti code
	- maybe use getline?
optimize pathfinding allocation (if dijkstra_map != NULL)
REWRITE THE ENTIRE DIJKSTRA PATHFINDING ALG, ITS SHIT
fix draw_main_scr adding an empty inaccessible line to the bottom of the map,
	possibly even to the side
overmap tiles?
	world would be travelled by moving between the overmap tiles, each of a
	different type

more tiles!
	- doors? + |
	- floor types - wooden, stone, metal?
	- trees, plants - grass  - ", O (trunk)
	- stairs - > <
	- statues? - weird unicode letters
	- furniture - tables, chairs - T? Π?
	- bones/graves?
	- fire
	- wooden walls - different color? #
	- path - . , :

more enemies - letters?
	- goblins
	- trolls
	- elementals
	- mages
	- dragons
	- slimes

more items
	- potions
		- mana
		- energy?
		- shield
	- weapons
	- armor

maybe save in a different file format (plain text?)
ranged attacks
	- for enemies too
fix various rendering bugs
	- line of @ between player and enemy
	- item that wasnt there
better algorithm for spawning enemies
