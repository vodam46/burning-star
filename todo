CRITICAL:

graphic? - raylib, sdl
 - 2 versions - graphic, tui

drawing
	how to deal with different window sizes
		- now only need to resize the screen areas

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file) ?

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehiclec))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the data files

world gen

movement
	have i missed something?

	- more world map gen

https://github.com/MaJerle/c-code-style
https://suckless.org/coding_style/

make code readable -> longer variable names ?
add a license (not needed yet?)
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? (could be done through settings)
	- settings
optimize basic_dir
	- fix, enemies travel untill diagonal to the player (maybe just illusion from scrolling map)
shorten all lines longer than 80
refactoring ?
initialization macros ?
different (stronger) enemy type
rewrite stuff
actual dungeons (?)
or actual worldgen?
	- perlin noise?
	- overworld - villages and stuff
	- dungeons - fixed size
rewrite wmap gen algs
make the drawing and input functions bindings independent of ncurses
	- ui.h ui.c ?
items
	- health potion, dropped by enemies
move data files into different directory (~/.local, AppData)
generalize the drawing functions -> preparations for graphics
