CRITICAL:

windows installation

(somewhat) unfinished files:
	- entity.h (entity.c)
	- tile.h (tile.c)
	- map.h (map.c)
	- ai.h (ai.c)

drawing
	how to deal with different window sizes
		- change map size ?

world data structure

	make it infinite ( load chunks from a save file )

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehiclec))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the types files

world gen

movement
	have i missed something?

CURRENT ORDER OF STUFF:
basic maze generator
	- cellular automata mazes ? 
	- recursive division
	- recursive backtracking
	- prim's - looks simple
	- aldous-broder	- looks slow
	- kruskal's	- needs alg to find if in cycle
(maze solving)
	- dead-end filling
	- wall follower - will be fairly easy
	- djikstra's
	- a*
fov algorithm
	- see thinking notebook
	- requires visibility
enemies
	- combat system

TODO:

CONSISTENT NAMING STYLE

file system

make code readable -> longer variable names ?
add a license (not need yet)
start writing tests before its too late
clean up the Makefile
wasd key input? vi key input? numpad diagonal input? ( could be done through settings )
make map struct
movement into own file - entity or map?
optimise the bin tree maze generator (if else statements)
convert all positional things (height width) to positional vectors
basic menu
optimize basic_dir
