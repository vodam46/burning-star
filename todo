CRITICAL:

graphic? - raylib, sdl

drawing
	how to deal with different window sizes
		- now only need to resize the screen areas

world data structure

	make it infinite (load chunks from a save file) ?

	tile struct
		- vehicles? (not needed (dont know if ill ever make vehicles))
		- visibility through said tile
	populate the data files
